## MUPET - Mice Ultrasonic Profile ExTractor

MUPET is a Matlab-based tool to analyze the ultrasonic calls emitted by mice (or rodents in general).  

It offers researchers the possibility to rapidly analyze audio recordings in terms of acoustics, spectral information and syllable statistics. It also allows building syllable repertoires, analyzing syllable category counts, and comparing repertoires between multiple recording studies.
